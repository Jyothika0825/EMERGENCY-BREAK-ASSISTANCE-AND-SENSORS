# Emergency Brake Assistance and Sensors (AEBS Prototype)

## Overview
This project implements an Automatic Emergency Braking System (AEBS)
using Ultrasonic Sensors and Arduino.

## Working Principle
1. Ultrasonic sensor detects obstacle.
2. ECU evaluates distance.
3. Driver warning alarm is activated.
4. If obstacle is critically close, braking relay is triggered automatically.

## Features
- Real-time distance monitoring
- Multi-stage safety logic
- Warning and emergency braking modes
- Modular embedded system architecture

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Relay Module
- Buzzer
- Pneumatic/Hydraulic actuator (prototype)

## Future Improvements
- Add vehicle speed integration
- Add radar/LIDAR fusion
- Add adaptive braking logic
- Integrate microcontroller CAN communication
